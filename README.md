# SudokuSolver
This project allows the user to solve any sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The idea of this project was inspired by the Tech With Tim YouTUBE channel, however, this project is developed in C++ and employs a few additional functions.

The board to solve must be placed in the assets folder in a file named board.txt. A sample is available.
