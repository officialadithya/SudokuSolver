# SudokuSolver
This project allows the user to solve any sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The idea of this project was inspired by the Tech With Tim YouTUBE channel, however, this project is developed in C++ instead of Python and employs a few additional functions. Some functions are also implemented differently, and this project also reads the board from a file.

The board to solve must be placed in the assets folder in a file named board.txt. A sample is available.
